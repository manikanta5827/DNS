# AI-Powered DNS Server

An intelligent DNS server that leverages Generative AI to provide human-like responses to domain name queries. This project combines the efficiency of a DNS server with the versatility of AI, enabling it to handle both standard DNS requests and natural language questions.

## Features
- **AI-Powered Responses**: Uses generative AI to process domain names as natural language inputs and return concise, meaningful answers.
- **Custom DNS Server**: Built with `denamed`, supporting UDP protocol for efficient query handling.
- **Real-Time Logging**: Logs queries and responses for debugging and analysis.

## How It Works
1. The server listens for DNS queries on UDP port 8090.
2. Queries are analyzed and passed to the AI model as natural language prompts.
3. The AI generates a concise response, which is sent back as a DNS TXT record.

## Setup and Installation

### Prerequisites
- Node.js (v14 or higher)
- A generative AI integration (e.g., OpenAI API)

### Installation
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/ai-dns-server.git
   cd ai-dns-server
   ```
2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```
3. Configure the AI integration:
   - Add your API key or connection details in the `generative_ai.js` file.

### Run the Server
Start the server using:
```bash
node server.js
```
The server will run on UDP port 8090.

## Example Query
Send a DNS query to the server:
- **Query**: `What is the capital of France?`
- **Response**: `Paris`

## File Structure
- `server.js`: Core DNS server logic.
- `generative_ai.js`: Handles AI prompt generation and response fetching.

## Future Enhancements
- Add caching for frequently asked questions.
- Support additional DNS record types (e.g., A, MX).
- Implement rate-limiting for enhanced security.
